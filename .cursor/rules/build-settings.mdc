# Build Configuration

Read and follow build settings from workspace configuration files (CMakeLists.txt, .code-workspace, etc.) including:
- CMake minimum version
- Compiler flags and standards
- Build targets and dependencies
- Build directory: `build/` (created by preset, do NOT create other build directories)
- Never create `build-cmake/` or similar ad-hoc directories
- If CMakeUserPresets.json exists, use `cmake --preset <name>` (check file for available presets)
